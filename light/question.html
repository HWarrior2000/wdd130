            <h3>Why is headlight restoration something I want?</h3>
            <p>Restoring your headlights is actually a better option than purchasing new headlights in most cases. If you are looking at buying a new headlight for your car you are most likely looking at aftermarket products. These products tend to not be as good as the lights that came with your car. They are either a one size fits all product or do not have as good internal reflectors causing the light output to be dimmer, even with the same bulb. Not only are these products generally inferior but they cost more than you would spend to restore the lights that the manufacturer of your vehicle intended to be used.</p>
            <h3>Do headlights need restored?</h3>
            <p>Over time the clear plastic that your headlights are made from will become discolored, foggy, or scratched. When any one of these things happen, they not only cause your car to look worse, but they also change its performance at night. When you can see one of these defects your headlights are not as bright as they would be if the plastic was clear, simply changing the lightbulb inside won’t help. This is because it is more difficult for the light to escape the plastic. By restoring the plastic, you are removing these defects allowing for the light to more easily escape the headlight.</p>
