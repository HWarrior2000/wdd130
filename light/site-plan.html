        We are looking to help you get the most out of your lights. Whether your looking to get your car back to looking new or just looking at increasing the safety of your vehicle by having good, clear, bright headlights is important for everyone.

      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <p>
        Headlights are an important part of our vehicle and safety while driving. The most obvious use of your headlights are to allow you to see the road at night. However there are a few other notable uses for your headlights. Contained in your headlights are also your blinkers, if you're the kind of driver that likes other to know that you are about to turn or change lanes than you probably use your blinkers allot. Another time your blinkers are active is when you turn your hazard lights on. These are useful when you blow a tire and need to stop on the side of the road and don't want to get hit by another vehicle. 
        There is one more way that we use our headlights. We use them to increase our visibility to oncoming traffic. Whether it's raining, snowing, or a clear day, when driving down the road you can see that drivers typically have their headlights on. This helps to increase their visibility on the road.
        If your headlights are cracked, damaged beyond repair, or completely missing, then replacement is most likely your only option.

      <h3>Q&A</h3>
      <p>
        Why is headlight restoration something I want?
        Restoring your headlights is actually a better option than purchasing new headlights in most cases. If you are looking at buying a new headlight for your car you are most likely looking at aftermarket products. These products tend to not be as good as the lights that came with your car. They are either a one size fits all product or do not have as good internal reflectors causing the light output to be dimmer, even with the same bulb. Not only are these products generally inferior but they cost more than you would spend to restore the lights that the manufacturer of your vehicle intended to be used.
        Do headlights need restored?
        Over time the clear plastic that your headlights are made from will become discolored, foggy, or scratched. When any one of these things happen, they not only cause your car to look worse, but they also change its performance at night. When you can see one of these defects your headlights are not as bright as they would be if the plastic was clear, simply changing the lightbulb inside wonâ€™t help. This is because it is more difficult for the light to escape the plastic. By restoring the plastic, you are removing these defects allowing for the light to more easily escape the headlight.
